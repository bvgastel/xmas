\begin{enumerate} \label{sec:bug-list}
\item	No model modified flag when packet changed
\item	Packet dialog not cleared on new/open network
\item	Model modified flag set after new when canvas was not clear
\item	Invalid maximized main window restore from setup (Qt Bug)
\item	Group select has not always key focus (e.g. pressing delete has no effect)
\item	Clicking new if canvas is not clear aborts application under Linux.
\item	Model setup not restored on model open.
\item With composite on canvas and click new then dialog save first $+$ no does not
work
\item Sometimes a composite its mouse area becomes inactive. (start with a clean
canvas , add a composite in the library and drag one on the canvas. Save new
model and click new or open). This only occurs with new (nameless) networks,
adding a composite is probably not handled well in the xMAS networks list and
therefore do only exists on the canvas.
\item	Several memory leaks
\end{enumerate}
