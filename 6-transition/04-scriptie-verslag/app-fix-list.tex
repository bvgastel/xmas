\begin{enumerate}\label{sec:fix-list}
\item	Grid snap on port center instead of component body left top
\item	Grid snap when drag a group of items
\item	Qt save as dialog not available in version 5.4.0
\item QML uses non blocking calls, cannot use yes/no dialogs feedback in a
proper way.
\item Use of destroy dialog to quit application from QML dialog to prevent
Windows warning (Qt bug).
\item Allow entering source expression when not connected (xmas parser)
\item New page is now done by select all and delete, instead destroy page and
create new page.
\item Remove qml convert logic in network.cpp, instead send a add component
request to the canvas by its name and type. Signal the update to component.cpp
which already does the request to xMAS for the other properties like x,y,â€¦ This
to avoid duplicate conversion and checks.
\item	\st{Tooltip for composites in library to show alias or filename}
\item	\st{Tooltip for primitives in toolbar}
\end{enumerate}
