Research of \Noc leads to problems of verification. Manual verification is time intensive and error prone.
Automatic verification of arbitrary networks causes state-space explosion.
Intel countered with the development of XMas (eXtensible M A S) which reduces the state-space using
eight primitive constructions the designer can glue together. This enables automatic verification of
certain desirable properties like freedom of cycles, deadlocks and maybe also livelocks.

The previous installment of XMAS in a C\# program turned out to miss the mark due to platform dependencies.
Additionally, using the non-managed environment of \cpp with the managed environment of C\# causes integration problems.
Our solution works on multiple platforms and roughly supports the same networks as the original program.
At the same time it integrates properly with the existing \cpp programs. Because all programs both the xmas
designer and the verification tools are written using \cpp maintenance is of both parts is easier to combine.

In this document we explain the research environment that the product will support, the requirements we followed and the 
functionality we developed using these requirements. We also provide hints for the following ABI project.
