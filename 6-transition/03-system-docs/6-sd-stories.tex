\section{Story tree}

Stories of the xMAS model designer project can be found in the Agilefant data in the xMAS repository.
To use this data you must set up Agilefant on a web server and import xmas/6-transition/08-agilefant/Agilefant\_xMAS.zip

The stories are based on three roles:
\begin{itemize}
\item A \textbf{researcher} develop formal verification methods to test on xMAS models.
\item A \textbf{designer} create and verify xMAS models with the xMAS model designer toolkit. 
\item A \textbf{maintainer} that maintains the xMAS model designer toolkit project. 
\end{itemize}

Figure~\ref{fig:story-tree} is a small copy of how this story tree looks like in the Agilefant tool.
