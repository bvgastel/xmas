\section{Story tree}

Stories of the xMAS model designer project are available through the Agilefant
tool and can be found in the xMAS repository. Agilefant must be set-up on a web
server before the repository data xmas/6-transition/08-agilefant/Agilefant\_xMAS.zip
can be imported. Once imported, stories can read or changed.

The stories are based on three roles:
\begin{itemize}
\item A \textbf{researcher} develops formal verification methods to test on xMAS models.
\item A \textbf{designer} creates and verifies xMAS models with the xMAS model designer toolkit.
\item A \textbf{maintainer} that maintains the xMAS model designer toolkit project.
\end{itemize}

Figure~\ref{fig:story-tree} is a small copy of what this story tree looks like in the Agilefant tool.
