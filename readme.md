XMAS DESIGN TOOL
================

This project is a design tool for NoC system (Network on Chip).
It uses the language Intel detailed in papers concerning xmas 

TODO: add details of these papers.

To generate the PDF version of this document use the command:

Use of Git
==========

Configuring Git

We are developing in a heterogeneous environment with both Unix and Windows
machines. Therefore it is imperative to have all files in the repository in the
canonical LF-only format. Therefore, Windows users must configure their editor to 
create the unix LF-only files in their sources. Also, Windows users should run:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
$ git config --global core.autocrlf true
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

to automatically get CRLF line endings which are suitable for the native tools,
and Unix users should use

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
$ git config --global core.autocrlf input
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

(this is a safety measure for the case where files with CRLF line endings get
into the file system â€“ this can happen when archives are unpacked, attachments
saved, etc.).

To be able to create commits which can be pushed to the server, you need to set
up your committer information correctly:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
$ git config --global user.name "Your Name"
$ git config --global user.email "me@example.com"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Please do not use nicknames or pseudonyms instead of the real name unless you
have really good reasons.

We use git for communication with the following use cases

1. New repo
	Clone the github directory using git as described below.
	*nix users from a bash shell, ms windows from git bash.

	machine/xmas> git clone https://github.com/gbonnema/xmas

	If you can become collaborator, you should be able to push
	your updates to the same URL.

	If you cannot, then you could fork the repo and do a pull 
	request.

2. Creating a new branch.
	You create a new branch "plan" with the command

	* git checkout -b plan
	
	do the alterations and commits until the modifications are finished
	then push the commits to remote

	* git push --set-upstream origin plan

	If you forget the option "--set-upstream" git will issue an error
	because it does not recognize the branch yet. Once the branch
	is created on remote with "--set-upstream", you can do a "git push".

3. Working from a branch.
	While working from a branch, sometimes master is updated and 
	if you want to be current with master, you need to merge the 
	changes in master into your branch.

	As long as the branch is only local you can do a rebase (see 
	several tutorials for how to do this). If you already published
	the branch, then it is better to merge master into the branch. That
	way you will not deviate too much from master.

	You switch to a branch with "git checkout branchname" and
	back to master with "git checkout master". Make sure you
	only switch with a clean working directory  i.e. after
	a commit and with no changes unstaged.

2. Collaborator
	Clone the repo, use it as you normally would with
	change-commit cycles and when you want to publish do a
	git push. If you set up git remote properly, then 
	the github repo should be updated.

	If you want to update your working directory with any
	changes from github, make sure you committed and then do
	a git pull. Again, remember to set up git remote.

	Sometimes a "git push" will result in an error, because
	your working directory is not updated with the latest
	changes from remote. Make sure to do a "git pull", resolve
	any conflicts, do a commit and a push to get your committed 
	changes to remote.

3. Any github user
	If you are using the system and want to update it, you
	can clone the repo locally, make the changes with the
	usual change-commit cycles. When done (including
	documentation and tests) you can do a pull request.

Documentation
=============

We use two document formats: LaTeX and markdown. 

Project documentation
---------------------
We use LaTeX for most of the project documents like the plan, a tutorial or a guide. 
Any kind of document that needs to look good on paper and is more than just a screenful.

System documentation
--------------------
We use markdown with pandoc format for most of the system documentation 

Development process
===================

We use Disciplined Agile Delivery (DAD) for our process and use a cloud based
agile management tool to visualise our work and to keep track of the progress.

Compile and install
===================

- README-LINUX.md			The instructions to develop from one of the linux platforms

Dependencies
============

This project depends on the following libraries:

Qt5.4		We specifically use Qml 2

Remark that we use as much from the Qt libraries as is possible.


Tips
====

- Set the warnings in GCC to Wall, and use the extra warnings in Settings ... Compiler ...

- When using Code::Blocks be sure to increment the option "number of processes"
  from Settings ... Compiler .... and the tab build options (usually not visible
  directly, you have to scroll toward it using the arrow).

- Switch the hmtl logging for building on (Settings ... Compiler ... build option tab).

- Use the tool configuration option (Tools ... Configure Tools ...). It starts
  a dialog where you can add any tool you have on your system and use standard
  macros to denote directory name, filename etcetera. As an example we use
  "git diff HEAD ${ACTIVE\_EDITOR\_FILENAME}" with the standard option "Launch
  tool in a new console windows and wait for a keypress when done".

  This will show the exact output including colouring that we would get
  using the console.

  I also use "gitk" without parameters and with the option "Launch tool visible (without output redirection)".
  This will start the graphical output for gitk.
