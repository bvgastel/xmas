Prepare a Linux platform
========================


Development
-----------

Install Qt5 libraries and Qt5-devel libraries.
Install QtCreator

Use your package manager to install the required software (see Fedora).

For development we use *.pro files with qmake-qt5. QtCreator works with .pro files 
natively.

After using qmake, you should be able to build, either with QtCreator or with your
default build utilities. From Linux we use make files.
