Architecture
============

This readme contains a set of directives. These are meant to help development
go in the sane direction. They are not meant to be "thou must" directives, more
like "please do". That way we can all keep on the same page. 

On occasion this file would change if we can improve the docs by working just a
little differently.

Building

  multiple platforms.
