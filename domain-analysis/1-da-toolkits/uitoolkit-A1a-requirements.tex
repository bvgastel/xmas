\section{Requirements for design tool}

Table \ref{tab:appl-requirements} summarizes the high level requirements for
the chip design tool. These are the main base for selection of toolkits. Each 
requirement may transfer as full requirement to the UI tool, partially or 
not at all. 
Table \ref{tab:team-competence-req} shows the team members' requirements in 
terms of competence goals. 
Table \ref{tab:uitool-requirements} summarizes the relationship 
of the project's requirements with the user interface toolkit.

\subsection{Justification of free software requirement}

The requirement for free software was not in the originally formulated
high level requirements, so some justification is required. The requirement $M0$ 
was added to ensure the free availability of the ui tool both now and 
in the future. The source of this requirement is a remark from the 
Open University instructions ``Hulpmiddelen en bronnen'' (``tools 
and sources'') with the following text:

\vspace{1em}

\begin{tabular}[t]{ll}
\begin{minipage}{.45\textwidth}

	``Wij gaan ervan uit dat de producten van het team uiteindelijk veelal als
	open source beschikbaar gesteld worden, dus iedereen mag in principe de
	producten inzien. In de overeenkomst met de opdrachtgever dient op het punt
	van de rechten duidelijkheid gegeven te worden.''

\end{minipage}

&

\begin{minipage}{.45\textwidth}

	``We assume open source availability of the team's products so that the
	products are publicly available. The contract with the customer should be
	clear on this point.''

\end{minipage}

\end{tabular}

\vspace{1em}

\noindent Demanding free software follows from this specification and the fact
that non-free software could potentially lead to non-availability of the
software due to license fees or the author retracting the software. We specify
free software as a must-have requirement to be ``clear on this point''.
