\section{Phase 3 Final selection}

\subsection{UI toolkit requirements} 

The requirements 7 (ease of use) and 8 (ease of learning) of toolkits can only
be measured subjectively. In order to compare these qualities this analysis
uses the Java Swing library as the norm.  This could have been any reasonably
well known user interface, but the Swing library is tought at the Open
University and should be known to all computer science students at OU at this time.

The final comparison takes some lesser requirements into account:

\begin{description}
	\item[7] The toolkit must be easy to use. 
	\item[8] The toolkit must be easy to learn.
	\item[9] The toolkit is well documented.
	\item[10] The toolkit supports the observer pattern.
	\item[14] The toolkit supports running concurrent processes\footnote{besides the event thread}.
	\item[15] The toolkit supports running the observer pattern
	from concurrent processes.
\end{description}

The ease of use of the three toolkits is comparable.
