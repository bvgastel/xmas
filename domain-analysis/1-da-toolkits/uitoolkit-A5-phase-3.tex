\section{Phase 3 Final selection}

\subsection{UI toolkit requirements} 

Table \ref{tab:uitool-requirements} shows the UI toolkit requirements. 
We can only measure the requirements 7 (ease of use) and 8 (ease of learning) 
subjectively. In order to compare these qualities this analysis 
uses the experience we have with the Java Swing library\footnote{This 
could have been any reasonably well known user interface, but the Swing library 
is tought at the Open University and should be known to all computer science 
students at OU at this time.}.

The final comparison takes some lesser requirements into account:

\begin{description}
	\item[7] The toolkit must be easy to use. 
	\item[8] The toolkit must be easy to learn.
	\item[9] The toolkit is well documented.
	\item[10] The toolkit supports the observer pattern.
	\item[14] The toolkit supports running concurrent processes\footnote{besides the event thread}.
	\item[15] The toolkit supports running the observer pattern
	from concurrent processes.
\end{description}
