\section{Requirements for design tool}

The defined platforms are all ms windows, mac and linux platforms. The goal is to find a
toolkit for the graphical program and drawing of the primitives and macro's.

	\hline
	M	& \multicolumn{2}{c|}{\sf\emph{\large Must have requirements}}
		\\\hline
	M1	& Cross platform & The toolkit must run equally well on the
				    defined platforms with respect to all relevant features
		\\\hline
	M2	& 2D drawing & The toolkit must be able to draw items on a
				canvas and treat graphical objects with composite
				behaviour or properties as a primitive object.
		\\\hline
	M3	& C++ integration & The toolkit must integrate seamlessly with
				the existing C++ code for analysis and verification tools.
		\\\hline
	S	& \multicolumn{2}{c|}{\sf\emph{\large Should have requirements}}
		\\\hline
	S1	& expandability & the toolkit should have a means of supporting expandability
				    in the target toolkit.
		\\\hline
	S2	& installability & The toolkit should assist easy installation or at least not
				    hinder easy installation.
		\\\hline
	C	& \multicolumn{2}{c|}{\sf\emph{\large Could have requirements}}
		\\\hline
	C1	& maintainability & The toolkit could provide some aid in ease of maintenance
				    like a documentation aid.
		\\\hline
	C2	& plugability	& The toolkit could assist in creating plugins for the application
		\\\hline
	N	& \multicolumn{2}{c|}{\sf\emph{\large Nice to have requirements}}
		\\\hline
	N1	& install util	& The toolkit could actively assist in creating installation
				    packages for each of the defined platforms.
