\section{Requirements for design tool}

The high level requirements for the project are aimed at the chip design tool. {\em see table \ref{tab: appl-requirements}}.
Student requirements in terms of competence goals.

Each requirement may transfer as full requirement to the UI tool, partially or not at all. {\em See table \ref{tab: uitool-requirements}}.
For analysis and comparison of UI tools we use the relevant requirements as defined in table \ref{tab: uitool-requirements}.
As multiple tools satisfy the high level requirements we use team preference and competence wishes to discriminate and select the tools.

\section{Requirements for UI toolkit}

Using the requirements for the application plus the competence requirements of mij team, the impact of
all these demands is summarized in table \ref{tab: uitool-requirements}. Only requirements directly relevant
to the ui toolkit have consequential requirements formulated.

In table \ref{tab: uitool-requirements} the term ``support for plugins''
is meant to be a weak requirement in the sense that it does not hinder
the design of plugins. The ability to support plugins directly is a nice
to have requirement. The derived requirements ``ease of use'' and ``ease of
learning'' are important requirements
