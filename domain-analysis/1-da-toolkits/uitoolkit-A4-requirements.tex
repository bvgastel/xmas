\section{Requirements for design tool}

Table \ref{tab:appl-requirements} on page~\pageref{tab:appl-requirements}
summarizes the high level requirements for the chip design tool. These are the
main base for selecting the tool kits. Each requirement may fully impact the UI
tool, partially or not at all. Table \ref{tab:team-competence-req} on
page~\pageref{tab:team-competence-req} shows the team members' requirements in
terms of competence goals.  Table \ref{tab:uitool-requirements} on
page~\pageref{tab:uitool-requirements} summarizes the impact of the project's
requirements and the team's competence wishes on the user interface toolkit.

\subsection{Justification of free software requirement}

The requirement for free software was not in the originally formulated high
level requirements, so some justification follows. This requirement ($M0$) was
added to ensure the free availability of the UI tool kit. The source of this
requirement is a remark from the Open University instructions ``Hulpmiddelen en
bronnen'' (``tools and sources'') with the following text:

\vspace{1em}

\begin{tabular}[t]{ll}
\begin{minipage}{.45\textwidth}

	``Wij gaan ervan uit dat de producten van het team uiteindelijk veelal als
	open source beschikbaar gesteld worden, dus iedereen mag in principe de
	producten inzien. In de overeenkomst met de opdrachtgever dient op het punt
	van de rechten duidelijkheid gegeven te worden.''

\end{minipage}

&

\begin{minipage}{.45\textwidth}

	``We assume open source availability of the team's products so that the
	products are publicly available. The contract with the customer should be
	clear on this point.''

\end{minipage}

\end{tabular}

\vspace{1em}

\noindent Demanding free software follows from this specification and the fact
that non-free software could potentially lead to non-availability of the
software due to license fees or the author retracting the software. We specify
free software as a must-have requirement to be ``clear on this point''.
