\section{Phase 1 Preselection}

The amount of toolkits available is staggering, so the first step is weeding
out the toolkits that do not support one of our defined platforms, are not free
software of just do not interact with C++ sufficiently.  For that reason this
analysis does not consider the following toolkits:

\begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{|p{7em}|p{25em}|}
	\hline
	{\bf name} & {\bf reason}\\\hline
	AppearIQ & non-free software. Ref: \cite{appear:appeariq}.\\
	Eclipse & a compiler, not a graphical framework. Ref: \cite{wiki:eclipse}.\\
	GeneXus & non-free software. Also not for linux
		    or mac. Ref: \cite{wiki:genexus}. \\
	Haxe & not a graphics platform. Ref: \cite{wiki:haxe}\\
	Max & not for linux, not free software. Ref: \cite{wiki:max}\\
	Mono & not a graphics environment, emulation
		of C\#. Ref: \cite{wiki:mono}.\\
	MonoCross & aimed at C\#. Ref: \cite{wiki:monocross}.\\
	MoSync & aimed at mobile platforms, no longer maintained. Ref: \cite{wiki:mosync}.\\
	Xojo & non-free software. Ref: \cite{wiki:xojo}.\\
	Smartface & non-free software\footnote{limited edition gratis available}. Ref: \cite{wiki:smartface} and \cite{smartface:license}.\\
	WebDev & aimed at creating websites. Ref: \cite{wiki:webdev}.\\
	WinDev & aimed at data centric apps with forms, works with webdev. Ref: \cite{wiki:windev}.\\
	XPower++ & Insufficient information, looks like an advertisment. Ref: \cite{wiki:xpower++}.\\
	Lazarus & A Pascal development environment. Ref: \cite{wiki:lazarus}.\\
	Ultimate++ & Does not support MacOS. Ref: \cite{wiki:ultimate++} and \cite{wxwidget:comparison}.\\
