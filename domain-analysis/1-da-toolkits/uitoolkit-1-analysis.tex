\section{Search approach}

\subsection{Search approach motivation}

Normally one searches literature for information on science subjects. 
For tool kits this may not be the most efficient or effective way of finding 
current tool kits. The problem with literature is that it is constantly
behind on the current state of affairs. Even though information on the internet 
is generally less reliable than literature is, in this case it forms a better 
basis to find a more complete list of tool kits. Literature does supplement 
what we find on the internet.

This analysis is able to determine a list of user interface tool kits starting 
from en.widipedia and fanning out through the links wikipedia provides and 
searching with a search engine. The dates on the sites provide information on how 
actual the data is. Cross referencing sites gives confidence in the correctness 
of the information. The next section lays out the criteria we used to select 
tool kits.

\subsection{Selection criteria}

Table \ref{tab:appl-requirements} on page~\pageref{tab:appl-requirements} contains 
a list of the main requirements for the design tool. These requirements generate 
criteria that we can use to find the most appropriate tool kits available. 
Table \ref{tab:team-competence-req} on page~\pageref{tab:team-competence-req}
shows a list of the team's preferences. Table \ref{tab:uitool-requirements} 
on page~\pageref{tab:uitool-requirements}
shows the implications of the requirements resulting in specific user interface 
requirements. The next section shows what steps we followed and what the results 
were.

\subsection{Selection process}

\paragraph{First step} Table \ref{tab:discarded-toolkits} on page~\pageref{tab:discarded-toolkits} shows the 
first wave of packages that we discarded with motivation. 

\paragraph{Second step} Table \ref{tab:compare-main-req} on page~\pageref{tab:compare-main-req} shows the result of 
the second wave of selection. This table shows for each tool kit to what degree it
satisfies the first set of requirements. 

\paragraph{Third step} Table \ref{tab:final-comparison} on page~\pageref{tab:final-comparison} shows
the final comparison.
