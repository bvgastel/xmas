\section{Result and recommendation}

\subsection{Result}

We reduced the list of the complete set of user interface toolkits (see
\ref{tab:discarded-toolkits} and \ref{tab:compare-main-req}) to 3
candidate tool kits: GTK+, Qt and WxWidget. In terms of main requirements they
are equal. Remaining task is to determine the best of these alternatives in
terms of detailed requirements. 

\subsection{Recommendation} We recommend the team to choose toolkit (GTK+, Qt,
WxWidget)\todo{choice} on the basis of <what is the main reason>\todo{motive}.

\subsection{Motivation}

We have chosen\todo{Expanded motive}.
