\section{Problem description}
The customer's request is to build a graphical chip editor for Network on chip designs
that uses existing C++ program to interface with and that runs on all defined
platforms: Linux, ms Windows and Mac. This implies part of the solution is a
user interface tool that works from graphical representation of chip networks.
This document is the result of gathering information and analysing existing
user interface tools that we could use for this purpose.

\paragraph{Comparison.} The number of available user interface and 2D drawing toolkits
is large enough to justify a comparison on the basis of objective criteria. The number
of features each toolkit has, is large enough to warrant limitation of criteria. The
structuring drive are the project and product requirements followed by team requirements
and finally team preference.

\paragraph{Requirements.} The customer specified requirements -- both non-functional and
functional -- each of which could have implications for the
choice of user interface toolkit. The team has its own learning requirements which
could influence the choice as well.

\paragraph{Goal.} The primary requirement -- the one that we did not explicitly
write down when comparing the UI tools -- is that the UI tool \emph{suffices}.
It does not have to be perfect, it does not have to dazzle. It should do what we
need it to do: anything else is either superfluous or extra. In the end -- all being
equal -- the team will choose from the candidates on basis of preference.
