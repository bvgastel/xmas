\section{Problem domain}
\subsection{Description}

The customer's request is to build a graphical chip editor for Network on chip
designs that uses existing C++ program to interface with and that runs on all
defined platforms: Linux, ms Windows and Mac. This implies part of the solution
is a user interface tool that works from graphical representation of chip
networks. This document is the result of gathering information and analysing
existing user interface tools that we could use for this purpose. Additionally
the customer has specified some qualitative requirements like maintainability
and install ability.

\subsection{Requirements for the approach}

The number of available user interface tool kits is large.  Moreover the number
of features each tool kit has, is large. This warrants careful consideration of
tool-kits where we start from the project's requirements and use the team's
preference to break any ties.  The primary goal is that the UI tool suffices:
it does not have to be perfect.
