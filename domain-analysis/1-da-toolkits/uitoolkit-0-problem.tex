\section{Problem domain}
\subsection{Description}

The customer's request is to build a graphical chip editor for Network on chip
designs that uses existing C++ program to interface with and that runs on all
defined platforms: Linux, ms Windows and Mac. This implies part of the solution
is a user interface tool that works toward graphical representation of chip
networks. The customer has specified some qualitative requirements like 
maintainability and install ability. This document is the result of gathering 
information and analysing existing user interface tools that we could use for 
this purpose. The goal is to formulate a recommendation for the team with respect
to the best user interface tool kit to use.

\subsection{Requirements for the approach}

The number of available user interface tool kits is large.  Moreover the number
of features each tool kit has, is large. This warrants careful consideration of
tool kits where we start from the project's requirements and use the team's
preference to break any ties.  The primary goal is that the UI tool suffices:
it does not have to be perfect.
