\section{Phase 0 Requirement Impact}
\label{sec:requirement-impact}

\subsection{Phase 0 selection results}

Using the requirements for the application plus the competence requirements of
the team, the impact of all these demands is summarized in table
\ref{tab:uitool-requirements}. Only requirements directly relevant to the ui
toolkit have consequential impact formulated.

In Table \ref{tab:uitool-requirements} the term ``support for plugins'' is
meant to be a weak requirement in the sense that it does not hinder the design
of plugins. The ability to support plugins directly is a nice to have
requirement. The derived requirements ``ease of use'' and ``ease of learning''
are important requirements for the people maintaining the system.

\paragraph{Remark.} The term ``ui toolkit'' may indicate one set of tools (like
qt) or a multiple sets (like one for 2D and one for GUI elements).
