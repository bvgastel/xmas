\section{Phase 2 Selection}

Using the main requirements including free software (first column) and the
defined platforms (second column) Table \ref{tab:compare-main-req} shows the
remaining toolkits and their rating according to the main requirements
including free software and defined platforms.

Among the 3 toolkits qualified as ``Maybe'' are some pretty unconventional, but
powerful frameworks. For instance Gled is a framework that stems from
scientific work and features the easy distribution of nodes accross threads,
processes and machines.

The resulting preferred toolkits are GTK+, Qt and WxWidgets due to the size of
the developer and user community.
