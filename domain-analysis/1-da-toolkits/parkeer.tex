\section{procedure for domain analysis of toolkits}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Use the conceptual architecture to derive what toolkits might be necessary.
    \item Determine criteria to evaluate each toolkit departing from requirements and challanges
    \item Determine relative importance per criterium (weight)
    \item Challange each toolkit using criteria
    \item Evaluate results and advise on decision
\end{itemize}
\section{procedure for domain analysis of integration}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Define the types of tools that the application will service.
    \item Define a generic interface that works for the tools of one type.
    \item Define a common generic interface between the design tool and all types of analysis tool.
    \item Define the dynamics of the integration between design tool and analysis tools.
\end{itemize}
