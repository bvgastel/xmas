\section{Approach of the selection process}

The character of Graphical User Interface toolkits (GUI toolkits) is such that
a reasonably recent list of toolkits can only be found on internet. The best
start is wikipedia which links to toolkits, each often linking to other
toolkits. The set of toolkits studied here is a sound base for finding a
toolkit that suffices for our needs. We selected the tools based on various web
searches leading among others to \cite{wiki:xplatf} and \cite{wiki:xplatf_gui}.
