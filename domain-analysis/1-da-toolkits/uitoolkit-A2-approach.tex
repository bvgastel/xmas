\section{Approach of the selection process}

The character of Graphical User Interface tool kits (GUI tool kits) is such that
a reasonably recent list of tool kits can only be found on internet. The best
start is wikipedia which links to tool kits, each often linking to other
tool kits. The set of tool kits studied here is a sound base for finding a
tool kit that suffices for our needs. We selected the tools based on various web
searches leading among others to \cite{wiki:xplatf} and \cite{wiki:xplatf_gui}.
