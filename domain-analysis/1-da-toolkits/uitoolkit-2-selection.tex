\section{Selection}

\subsection{Phase 1: Primary deselection}

The first phase allows for deselection of tool kits that do not suffice any one
of the most important requirements.  Table \ref{tab:discarded-toolkits} on
page~\pageref{tab:discarded-toolkits} shows the tool kits that were deselected
and why.

\subsection{Phase 2: Secondary deselection}

The remaining tool kits were examined in more detail. Each one of these tool
kits finds a summarized description in appendix~\ref{sec:phase2-listing}.  This
results in rating the tool kits according to the main characteristics required
in Table~\ref{tab:compare-main-req} on page~\pageref{tab:compare-main-req}.

Analysis of the results leads to accept the first four for definite 
comparison in the last phase. These tool kits have all necessary
characteristics required. The following three tool kits represent
2D tool kits that could be used in conjunction with the first four.

The next phase concerns the tool kits : \w{gtk+}, \w{qt}, \w{wxwidgets} and
\w{fltk}. See appendix~\ref{sec:phase2-listing} for a summary of each tool kit
and appendix~\ref{sec:phase3listing} for a more detailed description.

\subsection{Phase 3: Final selection}

The final phase results in consideration of these 4 tool kits. Each of these
tool kits satisfies all requirements either autonomously or in combination with
other tool kits. In terms of requirement based selection, the search is
finished.

The next section documents the considertions and the resulting recommendation.
