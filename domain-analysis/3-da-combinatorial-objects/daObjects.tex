\section{Introduction}
This domain analysis concerns combinatorial objects, along with primitive objects this kind of objects can be used to design xMAS models with the WickedXmas tool. In fact combinatorial objects are xMAS models itself but left open with unconnected ports, parameterizable and allow recursive reuse.\\
The benefits of combinatorial objects are those of re-usability, it makes complex things look simple and maintainable, it preserves correctness.\\
When designing an xMAS model in WickedXmas , the designer can make use of combinatorial objects similar as he or she does with primitive objects. Because combinatorial objects are xMAS models these can be edited just as any other kind of xMAS model except that there are unconnected ports as mentioned before.
\\To understand the vocabulary used in this document you can read the dictionary section first.

\section{Primitive objects}
Primitive objects are the base of combinatorial objects and determine the underlying structures. Secondly, when using objects to create a model, there are a lot of similarities between combinatorial and primitive objects. With this knowledge we can say that primitive objects need some explanation as far as these are concerned with combinatorial objects.
\\The xMAS language has only eight primitive objects, each object has a visual representation and one or more properties which can be changed by the user. Some of these properties requires a valid value otherwise a visual marker, shown as a dot as part of the object, will lit up red instead of green. Finally all objects have one or more ports, ports can be of target or input type and initiator or output type, ports are represented by red filled squares. All ports must be wired to an opposite type of port of a other object to form a valid channel.

\section{Combinatorial objects}
To create combinatorial objects, which means an open network, we need something to distinguish between an dangling port or a port that can be connected later when re-using the combinatorial object. Example : {p in PacketDomain | p < 100}
