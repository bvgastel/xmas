Remarks
=======

Avoid uppercase in filnames
---------------------------

Prefer lowercase characters in file names, especially filename extentions like .jpg.
This prevents cross platform troubles. Use a dash "-" or "_" if you have to.

New lines
---------

When in Latex, do not use "\\" for a new line, unless in a table environment like tabular.

Using an empty line will demarcate a paragraph. If you want the paragraph without an empty
line you can use \par. If you want the paragraph to start with a name, use \paragraph{parname.} 
Where parname will be in bold and will have more whitespace following it.
If you want bold without the whitespace, use an empty line / \par with \textbf{parname.}.

New page
--------

Prefer not to use \newpage, unless really necessary for the 
layout. In the current document, each \section is preprended by
a \newpage: it wastes a lot of paper without added value of
better layout.

Language
--------

Because we do not know who will be reading the source files we
need to restrict even comments to english, so our text is accessible
to non-dutch speakers.
