\chapter{Introduction}

\paragraph{Document use} The document is meant for
developers new to this project and for maintainers
considering a change. It allows a high level view 
and drilling down some to isolate the 
partition that needs change. Finally, the document
is for programmers looking for design guidelines.

\paragraph{Document structure} The document consists
of the high level class diagrams, some sequence diagrams,
some design patterns and finally the design guidelines and 
specific platform dependencies.

\paragraph{Document maintenance} Some of the diagrams -- especially 
the introductory architectural drawings -- were created with \w{Dia}\footnote{you 
can find \w{Dia} at http://sourceforge.net/projects/dia-installer/}.

Most of the \w{UML} diagrams we created with \w{Umbrello}. Be careful to use the most 
recent version as possible. From the the menu option \w{export all diagrams as
picture} or the equivalent option for one diagram one can create an image for
this document.

\paragraph{Naming} Make sure to create names without spaces so the exported filenames
will also be valid. Even though most OS's can work around spaces they
still are a pain to work with.
