The complete tool consists of a graphical design tool and a verification pipeline.
The design tool runs online (in a graphical environment) and is meant to aid in 
designing a Network on Chip (\Noc). The verification tools can run in the online 
(graphical) environment or in an offline (commandline) environment and are meant 
to do consistency and correctness checks on a model.
The case of offline verification is useful for verifying a model that is 
too big to verify completely during graphical edit cycles.

\paragraph{Usage goal} The goals for running the graphical editor 
or the verification pipeline may either be creating an \Noc or 
testing a verification tool. In both cases the dynamics are the same.

\paragraph{Plugin architecture} The verification tools and the graphical 
design toolkit communicatie through a plugin architecture.
The runtimes for verification tools will vary -- depending on the input --
from several seconds to a few minutes or longer. For that reason the 
verification tools run relatively independently from the graphical 
design toolkit. 

\todo[inline]{How will the plugin architecture overlap between 
the online and the offline versions of running the verification tools? I.e. how
will this architecture reflect on the currently existing verification tools?}

\todo[inline]{Where to flatten the model: in the verification tool or in the design tool (plugin)?
			   Could a VT work with composites.}

The graphical editor of \Noc consists of a toolkit containing
the \xmas primitives, the composites available in separate 
libraries, the graphical window, and the commands to 
prepare and execute the verification tools. The process of 
designing an \Noc consists of alternating an edit cycle with a verify cycle 
(see figure \ref{fig:overview-dynamic}).

\paragraph{Step 1 Edit cycle} The editor adds components (primitives or 
composites) to the \Noc diagram filling in their parameters and connecting 
components as necessary. Once satisfied the editor switches to prepare 
for the verfication cycle.

\paragraph{Step 2 Verification cycle} 
Firstly, the editor chooses the verification tools to be run.
Secondly, the editor fills in the relevant parameters for running the selected 
verification tools. Finally, the editor starts the verification processes causing
the controller to copy the parameters and the current \Noc model and start
the verification tools selected. See figure \ref{fig:dynamic-arch} for a 
detailed illustration.

\paragraph{Verification results} The verification tools 
will show their results and their progress while running. 
Depending on the verification tool, the results could be
graphical or textual or both. The plugin will show either
textual or graphical output allowing for addition textual 
or graphical markings on the network drawing.

Remark that the verification tools run in their own
thread or process depending on whether the output will be
shown in the design UI thread or an independent 
UI thread\todo{TBD}.

\paragraph{Communication pattern} The user interface implements
the observer pattern with respect to data changes.
Both the design tool and the verification plugin use this pattern to
propagate changes in the model to the user interface.

\section{Verification pipeline}

\paragraph{Scope.} The verification pipeline itself is
not in scope for the graphical editor. The connection to the verification 
pipeline is through the plugin architecture, where a plugin is wrapped 
in a C++ class that derives from \w{VerificationTool}.


\section{Verification Tool repository}

\paragraph{Tool repository} Each tool needs to register with a 
tool repository from where a control object could load the 
objects and obtain the necessary meta information. 

\paragraph{Meta information} Each tool needs certain parameters 
filled in. The tool should provide a method of entering this data 
both through a graphical user interface and through providing a 
file with input.

\paragraph{Generic meta information} Some parameters have no influence
on the structure of the component, other than specifying the number
of entries in a queue. Other parameters alter the structure in a way
that changes the network in size. An example is a number $n$ that
specifies the number of primitives in a spidergon topology (see \cite{}).

\paragraph{Design details} Each verification tool must register 
with the \w{VTController} or the controller. The registration 
involves informing the \w{VTController} about function, and parameters 
of the specific verification tool. The graphical editor will ask the 
\w{VTController} for available verification tools. This way the connection
between the graphical design tool and the verification pipeline
is as loose as possible while keeping control over the dynamics
in the process.
