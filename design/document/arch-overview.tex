cite\chapter{Architecture Overview}

This document partitions the system into 3 parts:

\begin{description}
	\item[Design Tool] This is the graphical and textual representation of the
	\Noc.
	\item[VT Plugin tool] This is the connection between the design tool and the verification
	tools. 
	\item[VT] The specific verification tools. This currently includes the combinatoric cycle 
	checker, the deadlock checker and may include tools. They all fit into and use the VT plugin
	tool.
\end{description}

This document describes the design tool and the VT plugin. Each verification tool has its own papers
and documentation. As far as necessary for the plugin, requirements from the VTs are included.

\section{Partitioning}

The complete tool consists of a graphical design tool and a verification pipeline.
The design tool runs online (in a graphical environment) and is meant to aid in 
designing a Network on Chip (\Noc). The verification tools can run in the online 
(graphical) environment or in an offline (commandline) environment and are meant 
to do consistency and correctness checks on a model.
The case of offline verification is useful for verifying a model that is 
too big to verify completely during graphical edit cycles.

\paragraph{Usage goal} The goals for running the graphical editor 
or the verification pipeline may either be creating an \Noc or 
testing a verification tool. In both cases the dynamics are the same.

\paragraph{Plugin architecture} The verification tools and the graphical 
design toolkit communicatie through a plugin architecture.
The runtimes for verification tools will vary -- depending on the input --
from several seconds to a few minutes or longer. For that reason the 
verification tools run relatively independently from the graphical 
design toolkit. 

\todo[inline]{How will the plugin architecture overlap between 
the online and the offline versions of running the verification tools? I.e. how
will this architecture reflect on the currently existing verification tools?}


We will flatten the model on behalf of the verification tools in the VT plugin.
Currently verification tools cannot work with composites but are planned for the future 
(see \citep[question 14 on page 32]{ou:team23-endreport}).

\section{Graphical Design Tool Dynamics}

\end{wrapfigure}

The graphical editor of \Noc consists of a toolkit containing
the \xmas primitives, the composites available in separate 
libraries, the graphical window, and the commands to 
prepare and execute the verification tools. The process of 
designing an \Noc consists of alternating an edit cycle with a verify cycle 
(see figure \ref{fig:overview-dynamic}).

\paragraph{Step 1 Edit cycle} The editor adds components (primitives or 
composites) to the \Noc diagram filling in their parameters and connecting 
components as necessary. Once satisfied the editor switches to prepare 
for the verfication cycle.

\paragraph{Step 2 Verification cycle} 
Firstly, the editor chooses the verification tools to be run.
Secondly, the editor fills in the relevant parameters for running the selected 
verification tools. Finally, the editor starts the verification processes causing
the controller to copy the parameters and the current \Noc model and start
the verification tools selected. See figure \ref{fig:dynamic-arch} for a 
detailed illustration.

\end{center}

\paragraph{Verification results} The verification tools 
will show their results and their progress while running. 
Depending on the verification tool, the results could be
graphical or textual or both. The plugin will show either
textual or graphical output allowing for addition textual 
or graphical markings on the network drawing.

Remark that the verification tools run in their own
thread or process depending on whether the output will be
shown in the design UI thread or an independent 
UI thread\todo{TBD}.

\paragraph{Communication pattern} The user interface implements
the observer pattern with respect to data changes.
Both the design tool and the verification plugin use this pattern to
propagate changes in the model to the user interface.

\section{Verification pipeline}

\paragraph{Scope.} The verification pipeline itself is
not in scope for the graphical editor. The connection to the verification 
pipeline is through the plugin architecture, where a plugin is wrapped 
in a C++ class that derives from \w{VerificationTool}.


\section{Verification Tool repository}

\paragraph{Tool repository} The design tool needs a reference to each 
verification tool in order to have the user select the 
verification tools to run. This information whether stored
in the code or stored in a file, we call the tool repository.
Each tool needs an entry in the tool repository.

\paragraph{Tool meta information} Each tool needs certain parameters 
filled in. The tool should provide a method of entering this data 
both through a graphical user interface and through providing a 
file with input.

\paragraph{Generic meta information} Some parameters directly influence 
the structure of the component. An example is a number $n$ that
specifies the number of primitives in a spidergon topology (see \cite{chatterjee-kishinevsky:xmas}\todo{check}).
\todo[inline]{These parameters need special care when passing through to the
verification tools. whether and how to flatten is still subject to discussion.}

\paragraph{Control in a loosely coupled way} An way to implement 
the verification repository is to have each verification tool register 
with a controller. The registration involves informing the controller
about function, and parameters of the specific verification tool. 
The graphical editor will ask the controller for available 
verification tools. The verification tools should also provide
a dialog for entering the parameters. This way the connection between 
the graphical design tool and the verification pipeline is as loose 
as possible while keeping control over the dynamics in the process.


\section{Component repository}

\todo[inline]{We need a (non-programmatic) way of defining new components, whether 
primitive or composite.}
