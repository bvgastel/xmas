# Fixed versus variable ports in combinatoric objects

## Modification history

* 22-02-2015 Guus Bonnema: document creation

## Problem definition 

The Intel papers describe variable numbers of ports for the combinatoric objects
merge, fork, join and switch. Should we cater for these possibilities in 
non-composite objects?


## Conclusion

On 22-02-2015 the customer -- Bernard van Gastel -- decided to support only 2 ports each for now.
So the merge will have 2 inputs, the fork will have 2 outputs, etc.

In future this may change.
