## Problem definition

During our first attempts at user interface definition the team
felt that using `FLTK` put us at a disadvantage compared to a 
more complete user interface toolkit like `Qt`. 

## Conclusion

We switch to `Qt` for the user interface toolkit.

## Motivation

The top 4 user interface toolkits all satisfy the main
requirements for selection. The choice made was done on
the basis of `mean and lean`, while during development 
we felt ease of development was preferable. 
For that reason we chose `Qt`.
