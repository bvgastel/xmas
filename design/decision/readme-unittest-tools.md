# Unit test tools for GUI

GUI test tools are very specific, in many cases they only
support one platform and aiming to test a specific type of
GUI language  such as java, wpf, web...

An other thing to think about is if using a GUI designer
such as Qt creator then it is most appropriate that Qt test
will be the best choice.

Most of the GUI test tools in the [Wiki GUI testing tools] or 
[Top 22 GUI testing tools] are not open source but commercial
products.
