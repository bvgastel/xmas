\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Document use} The document is meant for
developers new to this project and for maintainers
considering a change. It allows isolation of the 
partition that needs change. Finally, the document
is for programmers looking for design guidelines.

\section{Document structure} The document consists
of the high level class diagrams, some sequence diagrams,
some design patterns and finally the design guidelines and 
specific platform dependencies.

\section{Document maintenance} Use Umbrello to create and modify the
architecture diagrams. Use the menu option export all diagrams as
picture or the equivalent option for one diagram.

Make sure to create names without spaces so the exported filenames
will also be valid. Even though most OS's can work around spaces they
still are a pain in the neck.
