Use
===

We use git for communication with the following use cases

1. New repo
	Clone the github directory using git as described below.
	*nix users from a bash shell, ms windows from git bash.

	machine/xmas> git clone https://github.com/gbonnema/xmas

	If you can become collaborator, you should be able to push
	your updates to the same URL.

	If you cannot, then you could fork the repo and do a pull 
	request.

2. Collaborator
	Clone the repo, use it as you normally would with
	change-commit cycles and when you want to publish do a
	git push. If you set up git remote properly, then 
	the github repo should be updated.

	If you want to update your working directory with any
	changes from github, make sure you committed and then do
	a git pull. Again, remember to set up git remote.

3. Any github user
	If you are using the system and want to update it, you
	can clone the repo locally, make the changes with the
	usual change-commit cycles. When done (including
	documentation and tests) you can do a pull request.
